{\itshape Macro} to recursively release, or \textquotesingle{}give\textquotesingle{}, a mutex type semaphore. The mutex must have previously been created using a call to \hyperlink{semphr_8h_a1bbc843be5a41ea83d2693b2189fc0f8}{x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Recursive\+Mutex()};

config\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+R\+E\+C\+U\+R\+S\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+M\+U\+T\+E\+X\+ES must be set to 1 in \hyperlink{FreeRTOSConfig_8h}{Free\+R\+T\+O\+S\+Config.\+h} for this macro to be available.

This macro must not be used on mutexes created using \hyperlink{semphr_8h_aa6a00aa9b91a9e5b3ebe4ae1c3f115c6}{x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Mutex()}.

A mutex used recursively can be \textquotesingle{}taken\textquotesingle{} repeatedly by the owner. The mutex doesn\textquotesingle{}t become available again until the owner has called \hyperlink{semphr_8h_a398d66b17856c22dd49d39aaac42f105}{x\+Semaphore\+Give\+Recursive()} for each successful \textquotesingle{}take\textquotesingle{} request. For example, if a task successfully \textquotesingle{}takes\textquotesingle{} the same mutex 5 times then the mutex will not be available to any other task until it has also \textquotesingle{}given\textquotesingle{} the mutex back exactly five times.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Mutex} & A handle to the mutex being released, or \textquotesingle{}given\textquotesingle{}. This is the handle returned by \hyperlink{semphr_8h_aa6a00aa9b91a9e5b3ebe4ae1c3f115c6}{x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Mutex()};\\

        // available to another task until it has also been given back

        // these calls sequentially, it would be more likely that the calls
        // to \hyperlink{semphr_8h_a398d66b17856c22dd49d39aaac42f105}{xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()} would be called as a call stack

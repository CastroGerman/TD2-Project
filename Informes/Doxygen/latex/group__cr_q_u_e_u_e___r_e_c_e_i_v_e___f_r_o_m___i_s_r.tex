\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Queue} & The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.\\
\hline
{\em pv\+Buffer} & A pointer to a buffer into which the received item will be placed. The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from the queue into pv\+Buffer.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Co\+Routine\+Woken} & A co-\/routine may be blocked waiting for space to become available on the queue. If cr\+Q\+U\+E\+U\+E\+\_\+\+R\+E\+C\+E\+I\+V\+E\+\_\+\+F\+R\+O\+M\+\_\+\+I\+SR causes such a co-\/routine to unblock $\ast$px\+Co\+Routine\+Woken will get set to pd\+T\+R\+UE, otherwise $\ast$px\+Co\+Routine\+Woken will remain unchanged.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+T\+R\+UE an item was successfully received from the queue, otherwise pd\+F\+A\+L\+SE.

Run a co-\/routine.

\hyperlink{croutine_8h_a5333c649a2c063006ca3cd7a3b5b9240}{v\+Co\+Routine\+Schedule()} executes the highest priority co-\/routine that is able to run. The co-\/routine will execute until it either blocks, yields or is preempted by a task. Co-\/routines execute cooperatively so one co-\/routine cannot be preempted by another, but can be preempted by a task.

If an application comprises of both tasks and co-\/routines then v\+Co\+Routine\+Schedule should be called from the idle task (in an idle task hook).

Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
// This idle task hook will schedule a co-routine each time it is called.
// The rest of the idle task will execute between co-routine calls.
void \hyperlink{FreeRTOSCommonHooks_8h_a97fd430f36f8b065226e2bff9bad1de5}{vApplicationIdleHook( void )}
\{
   \hyperlink{croutine_8h_a5333c649a2c063006ca3cd7a3b5b9240}{vCoRoutineSchedule()};
\}\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}// Alternatively, if you do not require any other part of the idle task to
// execute, the idle task hook can call vCoRoutineScheduler() within an
// infinite loop.
